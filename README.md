Automatic compile-time instrumentation of Go code.

## Overview

[Orchestrion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrion) processes Go source code at compilation time and automatically
inserts instrumentation. This instrumentation produces Datadog APM traces from the instrumented code and supports
Datadog Application Security Management. Future work will include support for OpenTelemetry tracing as well.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Orchestrion is under active development. The supported features are rapidly growing, and the user experiece may evolve
> with future releases.
>
> Should you encounter issues or a bug when using `orchestrion`, please report it in the [bug tracker][gh-issues].
>
> For support & general questions, you are welcome to use [GitHub discussions][gh-discussions]. You may also contact us
> privately via Datadog support.

## Requirements

Orchestrion supports the two latest releases of Go, matching Go's [official release policy][go-releases]. It may
function correctly with older Go releases; but we will not be able to offer support for these if they don't.

In addition to this, Orchestrion only supports projects using [Go modules][go-modules].

[go-releases]: https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy
[go-modules]: https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more

## Getting started

1. Install Orchestrion:
    ```console
    $ go install github.com/datadog/orchestrion@latest
    ```

2. <details><summary>Optional: project <tt>go.mod</tt> registration</summary>

      >  You can automatically add `orchestrion` to your project's dependencies by running:
      > ```console
      > $ orchestrion pin
      > ```
      > This will:
      > 1. Create a new `orchestrion.tool.go` file containing content similar to:
      >     ```go
      >     // Code generated by `orchestrion pin`; DO NOT EDIT.
      >
      >     // This file is generated by `orchestrion pin`, and is used to include a blank import of the
      >     // orchestrion package(s) so that `go mod tidy` does not remove the requirements from go.mod.
      >     // This file should be checked into source control.
      >
      >     //go:build tools
      >
      >     package tools
      >
      >     import _ "github.com/datadog/orchestrion"
      >     ```
      > 2. Run `go get github.com/datadog/orchstrion@<current-release>` to make sure the project version corresponds to the
      >    one currently being used
      > 3. Run `go mod tidy` to make sure your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are up-to-date
      >
      > If you do not run this command, it will be done automatically when required. Once done, the version of `orchestrion`
      > used by this project can be controlled directly using the `go.mod` file, as you would control any other dependency.
    </details>

3. Prefix your `go` commands with `orchestrion`:
    ```console
    $ orchestrion go build .
    $ orchestrion go test -race ./...
    ```

    If you have not run `orchestrion pin`, you may see a message similar to the following appear, as `orchestrion pin`
    is automatically executed:
    ```

    > _Orchestrion_ at the core is a standard Go toolchain `-toolexec` proxy. Instead of using `orchestrion go`, you can
    > also manually provide the `-toolexec` argument to `go` commands that accept it:
    > ```console
    > $ go build -toolexec 'orchestrion toolexec' .
    > $ go test -toolexec 'orchestrion toolexec' -race .
    > ```
    </details>

> The version of `orchestrion` used to compile your project is ultimately tracked in the `go.mod` file. You can manage
> it in the same way you manage any other dependency, and updating to the latest release is as simple as doing:
> ```console
> $ go get github.com/datadog/orchestrion@latest
> ```

## How it works

The go toolchain's `-toolexec` feature invokes `orchestrion toolexec` with the complete list of arguments for each
toolchain command invocation, allowing `orchestrion` to inspect and modify those before executing the actual command.
This allows `orchestrion` to inspect all the go source files that contribute to the complete application, and to modify
these to include instrumentation code where appropriate. Orchestrion uses [`dave/dst`][dave-dst] to parse and modify the
go source code. Orchestrion adds `//line` directive comments in modified source files to make sure the stack trace
information produced by the final application are not affected by additional code added during instrumentation.

Since the instrumentation may use packages not present in the original code, `orchestrion` also intercepts the standard
go linker command invocations to make the relevant packages available to the linker.

### Directive comments

Directive comments are special single-line comments with no space between then `//` and the directive name. These allow
influencing the behavior of Orchestrion in a declarative manner.

#### `//dd:ignore`

The `//dd:ignore` directive instructs Orchestrion not to perform any code changes in Go code nested in the decorated
scope: when applied to a statement, it prevents instrumentations from being added to any component of this statement,
and when applied to a block, or function, it prevents instrumentation from being added anywhere in that block or
function.

This is useful when you specifically want to opt out of instrumenting certain parts of your code, either because it has
already been instrumented manually, or because the tracing is undesirable (not useful, adds too much overhead in a
performance-critical section, etc...).

#### `//dd:span`

Use a `//dd:span` comment before any function or method to create specific spans from your automatically instrumented
code. Spans will include tags described as arguments in the `//dd:span`. In order for the directive to be recognized,
the line-comment must be spelled out with no white space after the `//` comment start.

A function or method annotated with `//dd:span` must receive an argument of type `context.Context` or `*http.Request`.
The context or request is required for trace information to be passed through function calls in a Go program. If this
condition is met, the `//dd:span` comment is scanned and code is inserted in the function preamble (before any other
code).

Span tags are specified as a space-delimited series of `name:value` pairs, or as simple expressions referring to
argument names (or access to fields thereof). All `name:value` pairs are provided as strings, and expressions are
expected to evaluate to strings as well.

```go
//dd:span my:tag type:request name req.Method
func HandleRequest(name string, req *http.Request) {
	// ↓↓↓↓ Instrumentation added by Orchestrion ↓↓↓↓
	req = req.WithContext(instrument.Report(req.Context(), event.EventStart, "function-name", "HandleRequest", "my", "tag", "type", "request", "name", name, "req.Method", req.Method))
	defer instrument.Report(req.Context(), event.EventEnd, "function-name", "HandleRequest", "my", "tag", "type", "request", "name", name, "req.Method", req.Method)
	// ↑↑↑↑ End of added instrumentation ↑↑↑↑

	// your code here
}
```

Calls to these libraries are instrumented with library-specific code adding tracing to them, including support for
distributed traces.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues when using `orchestrion` please make sure to collect all relevant details about your setup in
order to help us identify (and ideally reproduce) the issue. The version of orchestrion (which can be obtained from
`orchestrion version`) as well as of the go toolchain (from `go version`) are essential and must be provided with any
bug report.

You can inspect everything Orchestrion is doing by adding the `-work` argument to your `go build` command; when doing so
the build will emit a `WORK=` line pointing to a working directory that is retained after the build is finished. The
contents of this directory contains all updated source code Orchestrion produced and additional metadata that can help
diagnosing issues.
