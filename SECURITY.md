## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in our code directly, please contact Datadog's security team at
[security@datadoghq.com][mailto] rather than filing a public issue on GitHub. Our security team will get back to you
within 24 hours, usually earlier. The security team's PGP key is available for download at
[`www.datadoghq.com/8869756E.asc.txt`](https://www.datadoghq.com/8869756E.asc.txt) in case you need to encrypt
communications.

We request that you do not publicly disclose the issue until we had a chance to address it.
