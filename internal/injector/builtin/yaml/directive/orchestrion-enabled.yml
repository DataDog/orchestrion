  icon: cog
  caveats: |-
    This aspect allows introducing conditional logic based on whether
    Orchestrion has been used to instrument an application or not. This should
    generally be avoided, but can be useful to ensure the application (or tests)
    is running with instrumentation.

  - id: Initialize to true
    tracer-internal: true # This is safe to apply in the tracer itself.
